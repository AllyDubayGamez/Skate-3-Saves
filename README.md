# Skate-3-Saves
A Website for Ps3 Skate 3 Saves
Site by: Ty Dubay Gamez

This site is for Skate 3 for the PS3
---------------------------------------

On this site you can upload via email, download, and learn how to get skaters onto you PS3.
The Save Files can only be taken out of you console with Multiman a Homebrew app which can
only be used with Ps3Hen or CFW or anything like that. Your can get the saves into your
Ps3 just by using a Usb.

After the shutdown of EmarbyHD's skater save site I've decided to make my own.
There will be new saves every week.

Hope you enjoy the site
